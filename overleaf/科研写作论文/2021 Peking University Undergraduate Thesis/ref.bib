	title = {{JT} Gravity and the Ensembles of Random Matrix Theory},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.03363},
	abstract = {We generalize the recently discovered relationship between {JT} gravity and double-scaled random matrix theory to the case that the boundary theory may have time-reversal symmetry and may have fermions with or without supersymmetry. The matching between variants of {JT} gravity and matrix ensembles depends on the assumed symmetries. Time-reversal symmetry in the boundary theory means that unorientable spacetimes must be considered in the bulk. In such a case, the partition function of {JT} gravity is still related to the volume of the moduli space of conformal structures, but this volume has a quantum correction and has to be computed using Reidemeister-Ray-Singer “torsion.” Presence of fermions in the boundary theory (and thus a symmetry (−1)F) means that the bulk has a spin or pin structure. Supersymmetry in the boundary means that the bulk theory is associated to {JT} supergravity and is related to the volume of the moduli space of super Riemann surfaces rather than of ordinary Riemann surfaces. In all cases we match {JT} gravity or supergravity with an appropriate random matrix ensemble. All ten standard random matrix ensembles make an appearance – the three Dyson ensembles and the seven Altland-Zirnbauer ensembles. To facilitate the analysis, we extend to the other ensembles techniques that are most familiar in the case of the original Wigner-Dyson ensemble of hermitian matrices. We also generalize Mirzakhani’s recursion for the volumes of ordinary moduli space to the case of super Riemann surfaces.},

	abstract = {Recent work has shown how to obtain the Page curve of an evaporating black hole from holographic computations of entanglement entropy. We show how these computations can be justiﬁed using the replica trick, from geometries with a spacetime wormhole connecting the diﬀerent replicas. In a simple model, we study the Page transition in detail by summing replica geometries with diﬀerent topologies. We compute related quantities in less detail in more complicated models, including {JT} gravity coupled to conformal matter and the {SYK} model. Separately, we give a direct gravitational argument for entanglement wedge reconstruction using an explicit formula known as the Petz map; again, a spacetime wormhole plays an important role. We discuss an interpretation of the wormhole geometries as part of some ensemble average implicit in the gravity description.},

	abstract = {In the 1980’s, work by Coleman and by Giddings and Strominger linked the physics of spacetime wormholes to ‘baby universes’ and an ensemble of theories. We revisit such ideas, using features associated with a negative cosmological constant and asymptotically {AdS} boundaries to strengthen the results, introduce a change in perspective, and connect with recent replica wormhole discussions of the Page curve. A key new feature is an emphasis on the role of null states. We explore this structure in detail in simple topological models of the bulk that allow us to compute the full spectrum of associated boundary theories. The dimension of the asymptotically {AdS} Hilbert space turns out to become a random variable Z, whose value can be less than the naive number k of independent states in the theory. For k {\textgreater} Z, consistency arises from an exact degeneracy in the inner product deﬁned by the gravitational path integral, so that many a priori independent states diﬀer only by a null state. We argue that a similar property must hold in any consistent gravitational path integral. We also comment on other aspects of extrapolations to more complicated models, and on possible implications for the black hole information problem in the individual members of the above ensemble.},

	abstract = {We reformulate recent insights into black hole information in a manner emphasizing operationally-deﬁned notions of entropy, Lorentz-signature descriptions, and asymptotically ﬂat spacetimes. With the help of replica wormholes, we ﬁnd that experiments of asymptotic observers are consistent with black holes as unitary quantum systems, with density of states given by the Bekenstein-Hawking formula. However, this comes at the cost of superselection sectors associated with the state of baby universes. Spacetimes studied by Polchinski and Strominger in 1994 provide a simple illustration of the associated concepts and techniques, and we argue them to be a natural latetime extrapolation of replica wormholes. The work aims to be self-contained and, in particular, to be accessible to readers who have not yet mastered earlier formulations of the ideas above.},

	abstract = {The quantum gravity path integral involves a sum over topologies that invites comparisons to worldsheet string theory and to Feynman diagrams of quantum ﬁeld theory. However, the latter are naturally associated with the non-abelian algebra of quantum ﬁelds, while the former has been argued to deﬁne an abelian algebra of superselected observables associated with partition-function-like quantities at an asymptotic boundary. We resolve this apparent tension by pointing out a variety of discrete choices that must be made in constructing a Hilbert space from such path integrals, and arguing that the natural choices for quantum gravity diﬀer from those used to construct {QFTs}. We focus on one-dimensional models of quantum gravity in order to make direct comparisons with worldline {QFT}.},

A recently discovered gravitational instanton which exists for general relativity coupled to axions is employed. The outcome of a single experiment in the parent universe is in general described by a mixed state, even if the initial state is pure. However, a sequence of measurements rapidly collapses the wave function of the family of universes into a one of an infinite number of 'coherent' states for which quantum incoherence is not observed in the parent universe. This provides a concrete illustration of an unexpected phenomena whose existence has been argued for on quite general grounds by Coleman: quantum incoherence due to information loss to baby universes is not experimentally observable. We further argue that all coupling constants governing dynamics in the parent universe depend on the parameters describing the particular coherent state into which the family wave function collapses. In particular, generically terms that violate any global symmetries will be induced in the effective action for the parent universe. These last results have much broader applicability than our specific model.},

	abstract = {We present exact results for partition functions of Jackiw-Teitelboim ({JT}) gravity on two-dimensional surfaces of arbitrary genus with an arbitrary number of boundaries. The boundaries are of the type relevant in the {NAdS}2/{NCFT}1 correspondence. We show that the partition functions correspond to the genus expansion of a certain matrix integral. A key fact is that Mirzakhani’s recursion relation for Weil-Petersson volumes maps directly onto the Eynard-Orantin “topological recursion” formulation of the loop equations for this matrix integral. The matrix integral provides a (non-unique) nonperturbative completion of the genus expansion, sensitive to the underlying discreteness of the matrix eigenvalues. In matrix integral descriptions of noncritical strings, such eﬀects are due to an inﬁnite number of disconnected worldsheets connected to D-branes. In {JT} gravity, these eﬀects can be reproduced by a sum over an inﬁnite number of disconnected geometries – a type of D-brane logic applied to spacetime.},

We also semiclassically compute the Hartle-Hawking wave function in two different bases of this Hilbert space. We then use these results to illustrate the gravitational version of the factorization problem of {AdS}/{CFT}: the Hilbert space of the two-boundary system tensor-factorizes on the {CFT} side, which appears to be in tension with the existence of gauge constraints in the bulk. In this model the tension is acute: we argue that {JT} gravity is a sensible quantum theory, based on a well-defined Lorentzian bulk path integral, which has no {CFT} dual. In bulk language, it has wormholes but it does not have black hole microstates. It does however give some hint as to what could be added to to rectify these issues, and we give an example of how this works using the {SYK} model. Finally we suggest that similar comments should apply to pure Einstein gravity in \$2+1\$ dimensions, which we'd then conclude also cannot have a {CFT} dual, consistent with the results of Maloney and Witten.},
